Visualized GDP growth and contribution of different sectors

Observations:
1) GDP growth picked up from the 1990s. Probably its due to opening up of the economy during that period
2) Barplot from 1990 shows substantial increase from 2000 compared to 1990. Rate of GDP growth was accelerating
3) Boxplot shows contribution from the agriculture sector has grown at a constant pace whereas the service sector shows a lot of outliers and is spreadout. Industry is somewhat in between agriculture and services. This points to the fact services have suddenly grown by a large amount after some years whereas agriculture has remained fairly constant. The increase in industry output is lesser than services
